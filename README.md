# Steemit Golos Switcher

Switch from Steemit to Golos and vice versa.
If you use both Steemit.com and Golos.io you have noticed that many urls are actually the same. Use this quick-switcher tool to go from the current url on Steemit to Golos and vice versa. 

E.g. when checking out https://steemit.com/@roelandp (my posts) you will see the icon of the golos website. Clicking on it will take you to https://golos.io/@roelandp 

If you like this consider upvoting me as witness on either of the two platforms. My username on both is `roelandp`
